# Genderfluid Pronoun Updater

This (Chrome) browser extension is made to facilitate the online lives of Genderfluid people, by allowing them to update their pronouns on multiple sites with little to no effort.

- Change pronouns on sites like Facebook, Discord, Instagram* and Messenger* with one click
- Automatic reminders to update pronouns, so you don't accidentally goof yourself

(*These integrations are yet to be added)
