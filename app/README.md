## Gender codes
- m == he/him
- f == she/her
- n == they/them

**Context behind the gender codes:**
Some sites (like Facebook) do not have a textbox or a status field to put pronouns in; instead opting for a select box containing pronouns to choose from. In Facebooks case - and this is the case for most websites - the selection is limited to male/masculine (he/him), female/feminine (she/her) or gender neutral (they/them). However, the naming schemes aren't consistent. Everything from "X" to "Rather not say" to "non-binary" or "custom gender". To make things non-confusing across development, there'll be 3 set codes (1 lowercase character) for which of those options should be selected. These are m for masc, f for femme, and n for gender neutral.
